Long/NNP ago/RB ,/, in/IN England/NNP in/IN Sherwood/NNP forest/NN live/VBP Robin/NNP Hood/NNP ./.

As/IN a/DT boy/NN Robin/NNP had/VBD been/VBN cheated/JJ by/IN a/DT few/JJ noblemen/NNS and/CC since/IN then/RB he/PRP had/VBD decided/VBN hat/NN he/PRP would/MD not/RB spare/VB the/DT rich/JJ ./.

He/PRP would/MD rob/VB the/DT rich/JJ and/CC give/VB to/TO the/DT poor/JJ ./.

The/DT Sheriff/NN of/IN Nottingham/NNP had/VBD placed/VBN many/JJ rewards/NNS for/IN the/DT capture/NN of/IN Robin/NNP Hood/NNP but/CC nobody/NN had/VBD ever/RB caught/VBN him/PRP ./.

Robin/NNP Hood/NNP had/VBD a/DT number/NN of/IN men/NNS who/WP served/VBD him/PRP ;/: they/PRP had/VBD made/VBN him/PRP their/PRP$ leader/NN ./.

They/PRP acted/VBD as/IN informers/NNS ;/: they/PRP would/MD warn/VB Robin/NNP Hood/NNP whenever/WRB the/DT Sheriff/NN had/VBD any/DT new/JJ plan/NN to/TO catch/VB him/PRP ./.

The/DT rich/JJ were/VBD scared/VBN of/IN going/VBG through/IN Sherwood/NNP Forest/NNP because/IN they/PRP knew/VBD Robin/NNP Hood/NNP would/MD attack/VB ./.

The/DT pressure/NN mounted/VBD on/IN the/DT Sheriff/NN of/IN Nottingham/NNP to/TO capture/VB Robin/NNP Hood/NNP ./.

He/PRP went/VBD to/TO take/VB the/DT help/NN of/IN the/DT king/NN ./.

The/DT king/NN refused/VBD to/TO send/VB any/DT of/IN his/PRP$ men/NNS to/TO help/VB in/IN the/DT capture/NN of/IN Robin/NNP Hood/NNP ./.

Finally/RB ,/, the/DT Sheriff/NN thought/VBD of/IN a/DT plan/NN ./.

``/`` Let/VB us/PRP have/VBP a/DT competition/NN to/TO choose/VB the/DT best/JJS shooter/NN in/IN Nottingham/NNP ./.

Robin/NNP Hood/NNP can/MD not/RB resist/VB such/PDT a/DT competition/NN ./.

And/CC Robin/NNP Hood/NNP could/MD surely/RB not/RB resist/VB taking/VBG part/NN in/IN any/DT competition/NN to/TO prove/VB that/IN he/PRP was/VBD the/DT best/JJS ./.

Robin/NNP Hood/NNP 's/POS loyal/JJ men/NNS dissuaded/VBD him/PRP ./.

``/`` Robin/RB ,/, this/DT competition/NN is/VBZ being/VBG held/VBN to/TO trap/NN you/PRP ,/, ''/'' said/VBD one/CD of/IN the/DT men/NNS ./.

``/`` It/PRP would/MD be/VB foolish/JJ to/TO talk/VB into/IN the/DT lion/NN 's/POS den/NN ,/, ''/'' said/VBD another/DT ./.

But/CC Robin/NNP Hood/NNP was/VBD not/RB willing/JJ to/TO listen/VB ./.

So/CC ,/, the/DT next/JJ day/NN all/DT arrangements/NNS for/IN the/DT competition/NN were/VBD made/VBN ./.

The/DT crowds/NNS were/VBD all/RB seated/VBN and/CC ten/CD contestants/NNS were/VBD there/RB ./.

The/DT Sheriff/NN turned/VBD to/TO one/CD of/IN the/DT guards/NNS and/CC asked/VBD in/IN a/DT whisper/NN ,/, ``/`` Has/VBZ Robin/NNP come/VBN ?/. ''/''

``/`` No/UH ,/, Your/PRP$ Highness/NNS ,/, Robin/NNP has/VBZ red/JJ hair/NN ./.

None/NN of/IN the/DT contestants/NNS have/VBP red/JJ hair/NN ./. ''/''

The/DT Sheriff/NN said/VBD ,/, ``/`` He/PRP must/MD be/VB scared/VBN ./. ''/''
